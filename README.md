# ADMF

This is the implementation of traditional mean field approach in many-body physics but equipped with AD engine (powered by jax for now).

So called mean field approach is an optimization problem to minimize the free energy with the parameterized ensemble ansatz (determined by non-interacting version of parameterized Hamiltonian in conventional approach).

For the correct perpective on mean field theory and its relation to variational inference, see [this post](https://jaan.io/how-does-physics-connect-machine-learning/).
